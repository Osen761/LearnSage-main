## Running Locally

To run LearnSage locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Osen761/LearningSage.git
   cd learningsage
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create Configuration Folder:**
   Create a `.streamlit` folder in the root directory of the project:

   mkdir .streamlit
   ```

4. **Create `secrets.toml` File:**
   Inside the `.streamlit` folder, create a `secrets.toml` file and store your API keys:

   [api_keys]
   GOOGLE_API_KEY = "YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_KEY"
   ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY= "YOUR_ASSEMBLY_AI_KEY"
   TAVILY_API_KEY= "YOUR_TAVILY_KEY"
   ```

   ```sh
   streamlit run User_interface.py
   ```


Make sure to replace `"YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_KEY"`, `"YOUR_ASSEMBLY_AI_KEY"`, and `"YOUR_TAVILY_KEY"` with your actual API keys. Adjust the repository URL and any other project-specific details as needed.
